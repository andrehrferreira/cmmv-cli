## Description

The CMMV CLI is a versatile command-line tool designed to streamline the creation, development, and management of CMMV applications. It simplifies various tasks, such as generating the project structure, running the application in development mode, and preparing it for production with efficient building and bundling processes. This CLI promotes clean and modular architectural practices, encouraging well-organized and scalable applications.

Leveraging schematics, the tool provides built-in support for generating components and features using the ``@cmmv/schematics`` package.

For further details, explore the [documentation](https://cmmv.io/docs).
